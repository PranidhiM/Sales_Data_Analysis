# Sales_Data_Analysis

Conducted in-depth analysis of sales data to identify key trends and insights for performance improvement. Utilized Python and data analysis libraries to process and analyze large datasets, identifying the top 10 best-selling products and examining the correlation between price and quantity ordered. Visualized monthly sales performance to reveal trends and patterns, providing actionable recommendations for optimizing sales strategies. Explored relationships between various numerical features using correlation heatmaps, uncovering potential areas for further investigation and analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to leverage data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights and drive data-informed decision-making.
